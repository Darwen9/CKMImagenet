# CKMImageNet[1]
This is an image dataset, and the images contain location-based channel knowledge.   
We dintinguish our dataset based on different scenarios. Inside each folder, there are detailed channel knowledge like channel gain, AOA, AOD, and the scenario view and our parameter configuration are also included.      
Subfolders named with BS contains at most 81 images, for we divide the BS coverage area into 81 partial overlapping subareas, and images beyond deployment range are deleted.  

This Dataset is developed by Southeast University and Purple Mountain Laboratories. For any further information, please contact Prof. Yong Zeng yong_zeng@seu.edu.cn; Mr. Zijian Wu wuzijian@seu.edu.cn
